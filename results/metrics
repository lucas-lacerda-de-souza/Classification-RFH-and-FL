3. Model Performance Summary
🧩 Morphometric Analysis

Follicular Lymphoma (FL) nuclei exhibited:
Larger nuclear area (p < 0.0051).
Greater perimeter (p < 0.0105).
Higher eccentricity (p < 0.0001), indicating irregular nuclear shapes.
Reactive Follicular Hyperplasia (RFH) nuclei showed higher circularity (p < 0.0026), consistent with regular nuclear contours.
Mean optical density (OD) differences were not significant (p > 0.1614).
These findings highlight clear morphological separation between benign and malignant follicular lesions.

🧮 Traditional Machine Learning (XGBoost)

The XGBoost classifier combining clinicopathological and morphometric data achieved:
Accuracy: 0.788
AUC: 0.904
F1-score: 0.741
Precision: 0.909
Recall: 0.625

Most influential features (based on SHAP):
Age was the strongest predictor (2.515).
Lesion location contributed moderately (0.246).
Among morphometric features, eccentricity (0.478), area (0.387), and circularity (0.373) had the greatest impact.
Features with p < 0.2 were selected for inclusion in the multimodal analysis.
The ROC AUC of 0.904 confirmed strong discriminative performance.
